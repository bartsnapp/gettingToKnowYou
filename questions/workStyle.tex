\begin{question}

    When it comes to class activities, everyone has different preferences. How
    do you feel about
    \begin{itemize}
        \item working in groups, or
        \item presenting your work in front of the class
    \end{itemize}
    Are you more comfortable completing homework on paper, or do you prefer
    using a computer? Feel free to share your thoughts on
    any of these areas.
