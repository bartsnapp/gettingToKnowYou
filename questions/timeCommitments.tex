\begin{question}
We recognize that balancing school and life can be challenging. Whether it's
sports commitments, long commutes, service to the armed forces, or any
non-traditional approach to college, we want to be mindful of the diverse
experiences our students bring. As your instructor, I aim to support you by
understanding these challenges. If there are any aspects of your life that
you'd like to share with me to help create a more equitable and supportive
classroom environment, please feel free to do so here.
