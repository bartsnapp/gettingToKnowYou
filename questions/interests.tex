\begin{question}
    Can you tell me about your favorite book, movie, TV show, game, or activity?
    What is it about this particular choice that resonates with you? Whether it's
    the story, the characters, the challenge, or the sense of community it brings,
    I'd love to hear why it's meaningful to you.
